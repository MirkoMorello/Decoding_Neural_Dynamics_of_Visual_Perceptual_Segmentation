\section{The Challenge of Predicting Human Gaze}
\label{sec:intro_challenge}

In every moment of waking life, our eyes dart across the visual world, selecting small regions to process in high detail. This sequence of fixations and rapid eye movements, known as a \textit{scanpath}, is a fundamental aspect of visually-guided behaviour. We make these selections unconsciously, a few times per second, guided by a complex interplay of low-level visual features, high-level scene semantics, and our own internal goals \cite{kummerer2023predicting}.

The task of computationally modeling and predicting these gaze patterns is a cornerstone problem in vision science and artificial intelligence. A model that can accurately predict where a person will look has immediate applications in fields as diverse as human-computer interaction, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving. More fundamentally, such a model serves as a powerful tool for science, offering a quantitative and falsifiable hypothesis about the mechanisms of human attention.

\section{From Spatial Saliency to Scanpath Dynamics}
\label{sec:intro_taxonomy}

The broad challenge of gaze prediction can be divided into two primary sub-problems, both of which are central to this thesis. The first, and most widely studied, is **spatial saliency prediction**. This task aims to predict the overall spatial distribution of fixations on a static image, effectively answering the question: "Where are people most likely to look in general?" The output is a single map highlighting the most attractive regions of an image.

A more complex and dynamic problem is **scanpath prediction**. Here, the goal is to predict the location of the *next* fixation, given not only the image but also the history of previous fixations. This requires modeling the temporal dependencies and oculomotor biases inherent in human viewing behaviour, moving from a static prediction to a sequential one.

\section{Thesis Contribution}
\label{sec:intro_contribution}

While deep learning has led to significant progress in fixation prediction, state-of-the-art models still fall short of explaining all the predictable variance in human gaze patterns \cite{kummerer2023predicting, kummerer2022deepgaze}. This thesis argues that a key limitation of current models is their implicit and often indirect use of high-level semantic information.

To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{DinoGaze}, a new probabilistic model for both spatial saliency and scanpath prediction. The core contribution of our work is a novel architecture that explicitly integrates two powerful sources of information:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rich Visual Features} from the DINOv2 vision transformer, a backbone trained with modern self-supervised learning methods.
    \item \textbf{Explicit Semantic Guidance} from pre-computed image segmentation maps, which are injected directly into the network's normalization layers.
\end{enumerate}
By combining these elements, DinoGaze is designed to make more context-aware and accurate predictions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks that our approach sets a new state of the art in spatial saliency prediction and provides a strong baseline for the more challenging task of scanpath modeling.

\section{Outline of the Thesis}
\label{sec:intro_outline}

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows. \textbf{Chapter 2} provides a review of the background literature, covering the theoretical foundations of probabilistic gaze modeling, the evolution of deep learning-based saliency models, and the key architectural concepts our work builds upon. \textbf{Chapter 3} presents the detailed architecture of the DinoGaze model. \textbf{Chapter 4} describes our experimental methodology, datasets, and evaluation metrics. \textbf{Chapter 5} presents our results and analysis. Finally, \textbf{Chapter 6} concludes with a summary of our findings and a discussion of future research directions.


\begin{itemize}
\item In a \texttt{.tex} file, text lines can have variable length.
\item Put a newline after every fullstop, see an example in \cref{s:example_section}; paragraphs are separated by empty lines in the \texttt{tex} file, so a newline at the end of a sentence does not affect the structure of the paragraph.
\item This is a tradeoff for using versioning tools:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lines too long (full paragraphs) would introduce diffs that are too large.
\item Fixed maximum line widths (e.g., $80$ columns) lead to editors to reorganize the paragraph to fit the width, causing again diffs that are too large.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%
You can use the percentage symbol (\%)\footnote{And notice how to insert a symbol of percentage!} to avoid a space between item list and this paragraph, so that the first line of this paragraph is not indented.

Enumerated list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Item 1.
\item Item 2.
\item Item 3.
\item Item 4.
\end{enumerate}

Sometimes, when you have a list of items for which you don't want to use bullet points or enumerations, you can use paragraphs with titles.
See the following text.

\paragraph{This is the first paragraph.}
This is the long text of the first paragraph.
This is the long text of the first paragraph.

\paragraph{This is the second paragraph.}
This is the long text of the second paragraph.
This is the long text of the second paragraph.
This is the long text of the second paragraph.
This is the long text of the second paragraph.

\paragraph{This is the third paragraph.}
This is the long text of the third paragraph.
This is the long text of the third paragraph.
This is the long text of the third paragraph.

Finally, \cref{t:example-table} provides an example of table.
You can add as many columns and rows as you wish.
Please refer to \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tabulary} for the documentation of the package.
In particular, see how to change the size and the alignment of the columns, if you need it.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{lL}
\toprule
{} & \emph{Column} \\
\emph{Column 1} & 2 \\
\midrule
text 1 & Some long text in the table. Some long text in the table. Some long text in the table. Some long text in the table. Some long text in the table.Some long text in the table. \\
text 2 & some other text. some other text. some other text. some other text. some other text. some other text. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabulary}
\caption[This is the title of the table that goes in the list of tables]{This is the caption of the table.\label{t:example-table}}
\end{table}

\section{General recommendations}
\label{s:example_section}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of line breaking follows\footnote{And this is another example of footnote; don't forget the full stop at the end of the footnote.}.
Do you see it? This is a new line in the \texttt{.tex} file but it is the same paragraph in the \texttt{pdf}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/logo-unipv-bw}
\caption[This is the text that goes in the list of figures]{Example of figure; this is the caption that goes below the figure.\label{f:logo}}
\end{figure}

\Cref{f:logo} reports an example of template to include a figure.
Just copy this template around and set the filename (without extension!), the size, and write the caption.

Use something like

\begin{verbatim}
width=0.5\textwidth
\end{verbatim}

to set the size of the figure as a percentage of the text width (in this case it is 50\%).
You can also specify an absolute width with \texttt{width=4cm}, but usually a relative size is fine.
Sometimes (very rarely, in my experience) you may want to set the size on the basis of the height of the figure, i.e., \texttt{height=4cm}.

The label \textbf{must go inside the caption}, otherwise sometimes \LaTeX\ does not handle the references correctly.

Every figure, table, listing or equation must be referenced and properly described in the text.
\textbf{Never use statements such as \enquote{previous chapter}, \enquote{next section} or \enquote{figure below}}: these elements may be moved during the editing of the text, thus if you use these statements then you may have to update the sentences every time you move something around.
This document uses the package \texttt{cleveref}, so use the command \texttt{\textbackslash cref} (e.g., this is a reference to \cref{s:example_section}) for a smart referencing (use \texttt{\textbackslash Cref} for uppercase).
It takes care of putting the right label and spacing before the number, and it will reference the item independently from its position in the text.

To use equations and to refer to them, use the \texttt{equation} environment like in this way:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:example}
A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}
%
And proper reference to \cref{eq:example}.

If you don't need to refer to an equation, you can skipt the numbering:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
%
In case of inline math, this is how it is done: $P = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot R$.

\Cref{lst:example-listing} provides an example of listing for source code.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,
caption={Example of listing.},
label={lst:example-listing},
float=tp]
def filter_difference(lines):
    filter_header_lines = filter(lambda line: not line.startswith(
        '---') and not line.startswith('+++'), lines)
    filter_difference = filter(lambda line: line.startswith(
        '-') or line.startswith('+'), filter_header_lines)
    return filter_difference
\end{lstlisting}


%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Formatting text}
%----------------------------------------------------------

Beside equations and math text, there are some other formattings that are worth mentioning:

\begin{itemize}
\item for everything related to software, such as file names, functions, variables, etc., use \texttt{texttt}, e.g., \texttt{hello.txt} or \texttt{var\_name}.
\item to put some text within quotes, use \texttt{enquote}, e.g., \enquote{like this}; \texttt{enquote} is better than other solutions because it is more robust and handles internationalization correctly.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Citations}
%----------------------------------------------------------

For citations from the bibliography use \texttt{\textbackslash cite}.
Here an example: \cite{example-citation}.

Citations go \textbf{inside} the corresponding sentence.
Note the position of the citation w.r.t. the full stop:

\begin{itemize}
\item \enquote{The algorithm has poor efficiency. \cite{example-citation}} \textbf{WRONG}
\item \enquote{The algorithm has poor efficiency \cite{example-citation}.} \textbf{CORRECT}
\end{itemize}

You have to populate the bibliography file \texttt{biblio.bib}.
You can put as many items as you want in the file.
Only the items that are cited in the thesis with \texttt{\textbackslash cite} will be included in the bibliography, as in the example above.

The items to populate the \texttt{.bib} file are in BibTeX format.
This is a popular format.
If you look for some paper or book, it is likely that somewhere the bib format already exists.
Try to search on the Internet for the title of the paper plus \textit{bibliography} or \textit{bib}.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Use of acronyms}
%----------------------------------------------------------

Acronyms are very popular in scientific and technical documents.
We use the \texttt{acronym} package.

All the acronyms are defined in \texttt{cap\_acronyms.inc.tex}.

Use the acronyms with \enquote{\ac{UNIPV}}, \enquote{\ac{Robolab}}, \enquote{\ac{LED}}.
The package is smart enough to write the long version the first time, and then to use the short version, like so: \enquote{\ac{UNIPV}} and \enquote{\ac{Robolab}}.

Sometimes you need to use the full version again, do it with \acf{UNIPV}.
If you need the long version only, use \acl{UNIPV}.

Plurals can be handled with \acp{LED}.
